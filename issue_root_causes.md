# Root Cause Analysis of Issues

## 1. Unnecessary Variable Declarations

**Problem**: Variables like `var1`, `var2`, `var4` are declared at the top but never actually used in the output.

**Root Cause**: The SSAUsageTracker is not marking all uses as consumed. These variables are defined by SSA values that:
- Are created by setup instructions in switch cases
- Have their uses marked as consumed
- But the SSA value itself is not being fully eliminated

**Example from Function 4**:
```
SSAValue { register: 1, version: 1, ... } // var1 - not eliminated
SSAValue { register: 4, version: 1, ... } // var4 - not eliminated  
```

These are likely PHI nodes or values that are only used in comparisons that have been inlined.

## 2. Undefined Variables in Fallthrough

**Problem**: In function 4, `var2` is used in cases 3-4 but not defined there.

**Root Cause**: The fallthrough logic is not properly handling variable flow:
- Cases 0-2 define `var2 = "low "`
- Cases 0-2 fall through to cases 3-4
- Cases 3-4 try to use `var2` but don't have access to it

The switch converter is not recognizing that cases 3-4 need the setup from cases 0-2 when entered via fallthrough.

## 3. Duplicate Variable Declarations

**Problem**: Variables are declared multiple times (e.g., `let var2; let var2 = 0;`)

**Root Cause**: The variable declaration logic is not checking if a variable has already been declared before adding another declaration. This happens when:
- A variable is declared at the function level
- The same variable is assigned a value later
- The assignment incorrectly includes a `let` declaration

## 4. Variables Declared but Not Eliminated

**Problem**: Many variables are declared at the top level but their uses have been consumed/inlined.

**Root Cause**: The cascading elimination is not working fully because:
1. It only runs after switch processing
2. It doesn't handle PHI nodes properly
3. Some uses might not be properly marked as consumed

## Solutions Needed

1. **Fix cascading elimination**: Ensure it runs at the right times and handles all cases
2. **Fix fallthrough variable tracking**: Ensure variables defined in fallthrough source cases are accessible in target cases
3. **Fix duplicate declaration checking**: Check if variable already declared before adding `let`
4. **Improve PHI node handling**: Better track when PHI nodes can be eliminated
