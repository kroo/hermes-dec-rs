# Dense Switch Test - Decompilation Results

## Summary
Tested all 10 functions in dense_switch_test.hbc. The original undefined variable issue in function 10 has been fixed, but there are still some issues in other functions.

## Results by Function

### ✅ Function 0: Global initialization
- **Status**: OK
- **Issues**: None

### ✅ Function 1: denseSwitchTest
- **Status**: OK  
- **Issues**: None
- All 21 cases correctly handled

### ⚠️ Function 2: largeSwitchTest
- **Status**: WARNING
- **Issues**: Unused variable `var0 = 100` declared but never used

### ❌ Function 3: switchWithBreak
- **Status**: ERROR
- **Issues**: 
  - Case 1 has only `break;` without setting `var1`
  - This will cause undefined behavior when case 1 is hit

### ❌ Function 4: switchWithFallthrough  
- **Status**: ERROR
- **Issues**:
  - `var2` is used in cases 3-4 but only defined in cases 0-2
  - Missing assignment in cases 5-7

### ❌ Function 5: nestedSwitch
- **Status**: ERROR
- **Issues**:
  - Undefined `var0` referenced in cases 0 and 1

### ❌ Function 6: mixedBreakReturn
- **Status**: ERROR
- **Issues**:
  - Case 1 has only `break;` without setting `var1`

### ⚠️ Function 7: switchWithFunctionCalls
- **Status**: WARNING
- **Issues**:
  - Duplicate declaration of `var2` (both at top and in body)

### ❌ Function 8: complexControlFlow
- **Status**: ERROR
- **Issues**:
  - Undefined `var0` referenced in case 0

### ⚠️ Function 9: switchWithTryCatch
- **Status**: PARTIAL
- **Issues**:
  - Complex Error object construction looks unusual
  - May have issues with try-catch handling

### ✅ Function 10: switchWithObjects
- **Status**: FIXED (was ERROR)
- **Issues**: 
  - Original undefined `var4_d` issue is now fixed
  - Some builtin_function calls indicate missing implementation

## Key Problems to Address

1. **Missing variable initialization in switch cases with break**
   - Cases that only have `break;` don't set required variables
   - Need to track which variables are expected to be set by each case

2. **Fallthrough handling issues**  
   - Variables defined in early cases are not properly tracked for later fallthrough cases
   - Need better tracking of variable definitions across fallthrough paths

3. **Nested switch variable scoping**
   - Variables referenced in nested switches are not properly declared
   - Need to ensure proper variable hoisting/declaration

4. **Duplicate variable declarations**
   - Some functions have variables declared multiple times

## Next Steps

1. Fix break-only cases to ensure variables are properly initialized
2. Improve fallthrough tracking to handle variable definitions across cases
3. Fix nested switch variable scoping issues
4. Remove duplicate variable declarations
